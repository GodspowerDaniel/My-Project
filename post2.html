        Life is coming for you. Regardless of your path, you will love, learn, make mistakes, have your heart broken,
        fall down, get up, and persist to the light when you’re in the dark. With enough time, every one of us will be
        carried through all the elements of life. But if you’re like me, and you wish to reach the edges of yourself and
        the world, you must learn to be a little more reckless. <br><br>

        By reckless, I’m not suggesting you put all your savings on black or wave goodbye to your family to live on a
        beach in Bali. What I mean is that you should be more reckless in your willingness to try, in your willingness
        to begin, and in your willingness to fail in the direction of your dreams.<br><br>


        Most of us handle our lives with the gloved hands of a fearful antique dealer. We cover ourselves in bubble
        wrap. We find a neat box and set ourselves in it. We refuse to quit the job that’s crushing our soul or end the
        on-again-off-again relationship that’s been draining us emotionally. We refuse to pick up a paintbrush or put
        down a word because what if we fail? What if we uncover that we really aren’t all that talented or clever?<br><br>


        Let me get this out of the way - no one is.<br><br>


        Steve Jobs nailed it when he said: “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no
        smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people
        can use.”<br><br>


        Everyone is just someone, but the people who succeed are usually those who understand that within each of us is
        far more resilience, creativity, and persistence than we realize.<br><br>


        We are not fine china, we’re adaptation machines. Adapting to new challenges and new environments is what humans
        do better than anything else. We live on the poles. We sleep in the desert. Among us are artists, scientists,
        and adventurers. Anything we can imagine, we are capable of doing. Usually, it just requires some recklessness
        to get started down that path.<br><br>


        After college, I saved for years to make the world walk a reality but when my parents told me they were
        underwater on their home I gave them most of my savings to help them keep their house. By the time I reached
        twenty-five, I had little left in my savings but knew my life had to break one way or another. I told myself
        that before I turned twenty-six, I would start the walk regardless of how much money I had - even if that meant
        living on rice and beans for the next five years.<br><br>


        While searching for a way to modify a bike cart to carry my things, I met Tom Marchetty, the owner of a local
        makerspace. Marchetty was gregarious in exactly the way I needed. He called a press conference and the articles
        written about my plans led to my sponsorship from Philadelphia Sign.<br><br>


        Certainly, that sponsorship was an unbelievable stroke of luck but without a willingness to fail, I would have
        never opened myself up to that chance in the first place.<br><br>


        Of course, being open to failure is easier said than done. We’re wired to maintain security and homeostasis.
        It’s what helped us survive through the millennia when calories were scarce and predators abundant. Today, fear
        of failure, rejection, or ridicule can be overwhelming, but in most cases, those are echoes of an era when
        taking risks could mean starvation, injury, or death.<br><br>


        Thankfully, overcoming the fear of failure is a practice, not an overnight transformation.<br><br>


        Starting a hobby you’ve been putting off, initiating a conversation in the park, or riding your bike to work to
        feel your heartbeat are all enough to rebel against the inertia of fear. Small acts may seem inconsequential but
        they build momentum. They accumulate. Each act of recklessness, no matter how minor, stretches your comfort
        zone, making room for larger, more significant actions and giving you the contrast needed to define yourself and
        your values.<br><br>


        In a way, each day of The World Walk was an act of recklessness. Every hour was an improvisation. I had to
        figure out where to get water, where to buy food, what roads to walk, how to manage a new culture, how to speak
        a new language, and where to hide away at night. Each morning, I took a step into the unknown; trusting that I
        had it in me to navigate the day ahead. Over the years, I maintained my courage with the very fact of life that
        initially scared me more than any other: time will pass and death will come.<br><br>


        When I was young, this knowledge paralyzed me, but eventually, I found liberation in it.<br><br>


        If death is inevitable and you bring nothing with you, then it makes no difference whether you die at seven or
        seventy. And if when you die is irrelevant, then to live anything but the fullest, most authentic version of
        your life is madness.<br><br>


        By risking failure, we allow ourselves to grow. We give ourselves the chance to transform, understand who we
        are, and bloom in the most extraordinary way.
