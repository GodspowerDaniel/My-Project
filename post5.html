            To most people, reading is a casual act: scrolling down paragraphs, flipping one page to another, filling up
            spare time. There are among us those who are
            <span class="essential in-intallics">quantitative</span> about reading — the number of books you’ve read is
            the barometer for your mental acuity.
            The course I was forced to take took a <span class="essential in-intallics">qualitative</span> approach. You
            could read
            just one
            book in a whole year,
            but that book becomes a journey of self-discovery, a literary voyage that enriches your cognitive
            library.<br><br>

            <span class="essential in-intallics">“We read to know we’re not alone.” ― William Nicholson, ‘Shadowlands: A
                Play’</span><br><br>

            Before that, allow me to ask you: <span class="essential in-intallics">If you could only keep one book in
                your library,
                what
                book would it be?</span><br><br>

            The course then taught us how to deep dive into a book, make annotations, how to challenge the author, its
            historicism, and your very own thoughts. The process can be distilled to three rules:<br><br>


            1. Reading is <span class="essential in-intallics">never an isolated act.</span><br>
            2. Effective reading is <span class="essential in-intallics">quality over quantity.</span><br>
            3. It’s not about who you are at the beginning of the book. <span class="essential in-intallics">It’s who
                you become at
                the end of it.</span><br><br>

            To most people, reading is a casual act: scrolling down paragraphs, flipping one page to another, filling up
            spare time. There are among us those who are <span class="essential in-intallics">quantitative</span> about
            reading — the
            number of books you’ve read is the
            barometer for your mental acuity.
            <br><br>

            The course I was forced to take took a <span class="essential in-intallics">qualitative</span> approach. You
            could read
            just one book in a whole year,
            but that book becomes a journey of self-discovery, a literary voyage that enriches your cognitive
            library.<br><br>

            <span class="essential in-intallics">The book you read will accompany you for life.</span> That book can be
            read again
            and again, each time using the
            same approach, and you will rediscover pockets of imagination you never knew existed. It was Oscar Wilde who
            said, “If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at
            all.”<br><br>

            <span class="essential in-intallics">Being a purposeful reader begins by asking questions as you
                read.</span> A clean
            book is one that has not been read. And yes, it can be exhausting. That is an indicator that you’re reading
            correctly, as pointed out by William Styron in ‘Conversations with William Styron’: “A great book should
            leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading.”
            <br><br>


            What that seems to suggest is that casual reading is a good pastime but without being sedulous, what you
            read becomes fleeting.<br><br>


            Now, you’re probably thinking aloud, “No wonder I don’t recall anything from that book I read at the airport
            lounge…”
            <br><br>

        <p class="essential in-intallics">“Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most
            accessible and
            wisest of counselors,
            and the most patient of teachers.”
            ― Charles W. Eliot, ‘The Durable Satisfactions of Life’</p>
        <br><br>

        When reading, you’re not alone. You’re never alone.
        There is the author walking along the path with you. Ask the author questions. Challenge the author as if he/she
        is right there seated opposite you. Begin with what you agree or disagree with the author. “This is ridiculous
        Dickens! I don’t agree that Bill Sikes is more malicious than Fagin who is the bigger villain because he is
        essentially a groomer…”
        Did the author’s actions challenge your principles? Did it bother you? Why? Did it frustrate you? If you could
        rewrite the situation, what would you do differently? All of these are written on the side of the page. Yes,
        margins on a page have a purpose — to be scribbled on. You are to make a mess of the entire book with your
        annotations. Remember what Stephen King said, “If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the
        tools) to write. Simple as that.”
        If you’re one to feel fearful of ‘soiling’ a book with ideas, lead and ink, your reading depth may also come
        into question. Although you can write separately in a journal, having the thoughts written on the same page, in
        between the lines, surrounding circled keywords, helps to put you, your thinking and the author on the same
        page, literally and metaphorically.<br><br>

        By the time you reached the end of your book, it has been a profound and enlightening experience. With a
        collection of such endeavors, it rings differently when I ask the following question: If you could only keep one
        book in your library <span class="essential in-intallics">that signifies your life, what book would that
            be?</span><br><br>
